# Installing and using the components

To install the components:

## Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/canary-react @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/canary-react @ukic/fonts
```

## Step two

Import the component(s) in your React files.

```jsx
import { IcComponent } from "@ukic/canary-react";
```

## Step three

To get the correct styling with the ICDS components, import the core CSS file.

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/canary-react/dist/core/core.css";
```

In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern standards, each of the ICDS components uses styles from a global CSS file based on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the ICDS components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/canary-react/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

## Step four

The `@ukic/canary-react` package will need to be transformed before you can use these components in Jest tests.

Add a `transformIgnorePatterns` field with the value `["/node_modules/(?!@ukic/canary-react)"]` to your Jest config.
