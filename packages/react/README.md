The [Intelligence Community Design System](https://design.sis.gov.uk) helps the United Kingdom's Intelligence Community (MI6, GCHQ, MI5, and partners) to quickly build powerful capabilities that are accessible and easy to use.

This is a joint project led by [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk), working with [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk) and [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk).

## Installing

To install the components:

### Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/react @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/react @ukic/fonts
```

### Step two

Import the component(s) in your React files.

```jsx
import { IcComponent } from "@ukic/react";
```

### Step three

To get the correct styling with the ICDS components, import the core CSS file.

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/react/dist/core/core.css";
```

### Step four

The `@ukic/react` package will need to be transformed before you can use these components in Jest tests.

Add a `transformIgnorePatterns` field with the value `["/node_modules/(?!@ukic/react)"]` to your Jest config.
