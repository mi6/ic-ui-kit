# The UK Intelligence Community NextJs Storybook

The [Intelligence Community Design System](https://design.sis.gov.uk) helps the United Kingdom's Intelligence Community (MI6, GCHQ, MI5, and partners) to quickly build powerful capabilities that are accessible and easy to use.

This is a joint project led by [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk), working with [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk), [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk) and [HMGCC](https://www.hmgcc.gov.uk) (our national security partner).
