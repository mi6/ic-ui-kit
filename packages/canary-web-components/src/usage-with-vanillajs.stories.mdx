## Installing

### Step one

Install the packages with `npm` or `yarn`.

```shell
npm install @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts

yarn add @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts
```

### Step two

Import `defineCustomElements` in your top level JS file and call it at the bottom of the file:

```js
import { defineCustomElements } from "@ukic/canary-web-components/loader";

// ...

defineCustomElements();
```

### Step three

Import the ICDS CSS files into your app's top level CSS file:

```css
/* In your top level CSS file */
/* Depending on your setup, a path to node_modules may be needed instead */
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
@import "@ukic/canary-web-components/dist/core/core.css";
```

Import the normalised styles that are used within the ICDS components if you would like to apply them to the rest of your project and any slotted elements:

```css
@import "@ukic/canary-web-components/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

### Step four

Declare and use components in your file, e.g.:

```html
<ic-data-table ...></ic-data-table>
<!-- It is possible to use components from @ukic/web-components as these are brought through from @ukic/canary-web-components -->
<ic-button>...</ic-button>
```
