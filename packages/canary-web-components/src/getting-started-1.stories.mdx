# Installing and using the components

## Using the components

To use the components in your project, follow the specific instructions for your project type:

1. [Angular](/story/usage-with-angular--page) project
2. [Vue](/story/usage-with-vue--page) project

While we have chosen to only document instructions for Angular and Vue, web components should work in a number of other framework
choices (e.g. Svelte). For more information, see [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).
