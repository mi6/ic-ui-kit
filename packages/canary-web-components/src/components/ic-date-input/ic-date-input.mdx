# \[Canary]: Date Input

Use the date input component to manually type in a date in different formats.

The input `label` is the only required attribute for date input.

Click the 'Component API' tab to view all the available attributes, events and slots for date input.

To use the date input component, import `@ukic/canary-web-components` into your application.

### Basic

Each example below demonstrates the date input in three different date formats:

- DD/MM/YYYY (Default date format)
- MM/DD/YYYY
- YYYY/MM/DD

Dates can be added by manually typing into the input or using the up and down arrow keys.

To move between day, month and year using the keyboard, provide the required values based on the placeholders or use `/` or `-`.

By default, the helper text displays the date format.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  format="MM/DD/YYYY"
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  format="YYYY/MM/DD"
></ic-date-input>
```

Retrieving the date input value via `icChange` returns the date as a Date object.

The event returns the Date object once day, month and year have been entered.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.IcChangeEvent} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>
<script>
  const dateInput = document.querySelector("ic-date-input");
  dateInput.addEventListener("icChange", function (event) {
    console.log(event.detail.value);
  });
</script>
```

### With value

To set a value to the date input, pass the date value in the relevant date format.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.WithValue} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  date-format="DD/MM/YYYY"
  value="21/01/2001"
></ic-date-input>
```

The date input also accepts a number of different date formats within the value attribute.

- [Date object](#date-object)
- [Zulu datetime](#zulu-datetime)
- [With hyphens (DD-MM-YYYY)](#with-hyphens)
- [Epoch time](#epoch-time)

#### Date object

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.DateObject} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>
<script>
  const dateInputDate = document.querySelector("ic-date-input");
  dateInputDate.value = new Date("28 November 2021");
</script>
```

#### Zulu datetime

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.ZuluTime} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>
<script>
  const dateInputDate = document.querySelector("ic-date-input");
  dateInputDate.value = new Date("1 May 1990").toISOString();
</script>
```

#### With hyphens

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.WithHyphens} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>
<script>
  const dateInputDate = document.querySelector("ic-date-input");
  dateInputDate.value = "25-05-2005";
</script>
```

#### Epoch time

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.EpochTime} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>
<script>
  const dateInputDate = document.querySelector("ic-date-input");
  dateInputString.value = Date.now();
</script>
```

### Required.

To set the date input as a required field, set the `required` attribute to `true`. This will add an asterisk at the end of the date input label.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.Required} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  date-format="DD/MM/YYYY"
  required="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Hide label

To hide the label, set the `hide-label` attribute to `true`. The required `label` will still be read out by screen readers.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.HideLabel} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  date-format="DD/MM/YYYY"
  hide-label="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Disabled

Set the `disabled` attribute to `true` to prevent interaction with the date input.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  disabled="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Sizes

The date input is available in three different sizes:

- small
- default
- large

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.Sizes} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  size="small"
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  size="large"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Custom helper text

Use the helper text to add additional detail for the date input.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.CustomHelperText} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  helper-text="We will have your order ready for you on this date"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Hide helper text

Hide visible helper text.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.HideHelperText} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  helper-text="You cannot see me, but you can hear me"
  hide-helper-text="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Custom validation

Validation on date input is set via `validation-status` and `validation-text`.

`validation-status` will set the style of the validation message. `validation-status` accepts:

- `error`
- `warning`
- `success`

`validation-status` is required for the `validation-text` to appear.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.CustomValidation} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  validation-status="error"
  validation-text="There is a coffee shortage forecast for that day. Please choose a different date."
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  validation-status="warning"
  validation-text="Please be aware that there may be a coffee shortage on that day."
></ic-date-input>

<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  validation-status="success"
  validation-text="Your coffee will be available for you to collect on this day."
></ic-date-input>
```

### Disabled past dates

Validation can be set on the date input if a date in the past has been set by setting the `disable-past` attribute to `true`.

Enter a date in the past to view the validation message.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.DisabledPastDates} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  disable-past="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Disabled future dates

Validation can be set on the date input if a date in the future has been set by setting the `disable-future` attribute to `true`.

Enter a date in the future to view the validation message.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.DisabledFutureDates} />
</Canvas>

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  disable-future="true"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Min and max

It is possible to set a min and max date range. If a date is set and it is before the min or after the max date, a validation error will appear.

The min or max dates accept the following date formats:

- [Date string](#with-value) (with slashes i.e. DD/MM/YYYY)
- [Date string](#with-hyphens) (with hyphens i.e. DD-MM-YYYY)
- [Date object](#date-object)
- [Zulu time](#zulu-time)

Enter a date after 2nd Jan 2023 and before 20th July to view the validation message.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.MinAndMax} />
</Canvas>

In this code snippet, the min and max have been set using two different date formats to demonstrate its flexibility.

```html
<ic-date-input
  label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
  min="02/01/2023"
  max="20-07-2023"
></ic-date-input>
```

### Form

When the date input component is used within a form, the date value is returned as an ISO string.

The value is console logged to the browser dev tools.

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.Form} />
</Canvas>

```html
<form>
  <ic-date-input
    label="When would you like to collect your coffee?"
    value="13/03/1951"
  ></ic-date-input>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  <input type="reset" value="Reset" />
  <script>
    document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", (ev) => {
      ev.preventDefault();
      console.log(
        document.querySelector('input[name^="ic-date-input-"]').value
      );
    });
  </script>
</form>
```

### With clearing value

The date input can be cleared by setting the the value attribute to one of the following:

- empty string
- `null`
- `undefined`

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story of={IcDateInputStories.WithClearingValue} />
</Canvas>
