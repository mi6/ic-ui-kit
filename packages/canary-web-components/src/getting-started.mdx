# Installing and using the components

## Using the components

To use the components in your project, follow the specific instructions for your project type:

1. [Angular](/docs/usage-with-angular--docs) project
2. [Vanilla JS](/docs/usage-with-vanilla-js--docs)
3. [Vue](/docs/usage-with-vue--docs) project

While we have chosen to only document instructions for Angular and Vue, web components should work in a number of other framework
choices (e.g. Svelte). For more information, see [Custom Elements Everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).
