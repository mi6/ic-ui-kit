The [Intelligence Community Design System](https://design.sis.gov.uk) helps the United Kingdom's Intelligence Community (MI6, GCHQ, MI5, and partners) to quickly build powerful capabilities that are accessible and easy to use.

This is a joint project led by [MI6](https://www.sis.gov.uk), working with [GCHQ](https://www.gchq.gov.uk) and [MI5](https://www.mi5.gov.uk).

## Installing

To install the components:

### Step one

In the root of your project:

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts
```

### Step two

Import `defineCustomElements` in your file. Where you do this will depend on your framework or build tool, but the format is as follows:

```jsx
import { defineCustomElements } from "@ukic/canary-web-components/loader";
```

### Step three

Call `defineCustomElements` in your file. Again, the file you edit will depend on your framework or build tool, but the format is as follows:

```jsx
//other code
...
defineCustomElements();
```

### Step four

In your HTML, you can now declare a component as follows:

```jsx
<ic-data-table ...></ic-data-table>
```

### Step five

To get the correct styling with the ICDS components, import the core CSS file. Depending on your framework or build tool, this can be included in either a CSS file or Javascript\Typescript file.

Add the following into the top level CSS file for your project.

```css
@import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
/* Include @import "@ukic/web-components/dist/core/core.css if used alongside @ukic/web-components package */
@import "@ukic/canary-web-components/dist/core/core.css";
```

In order to be rendered consistently across browsers and in line with modern standards, each of the ICDS components uses styles from a global CSS file based on [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). 

If you would like to import these styles to apply them to the rest of your project and slotted elements used within any of the ICDS components, add the following into the top level CSS file as well.

```css
@import "@ukic/canary-web-components/dist/core/normalize.css";
```

## Webpack example

Webpack is a tool for bundling web applications. This example assumes the following config in `webpack.config.js`. For more detailed information on Webpack configuration, please refer to the Webpack documentation.

```jsx
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
  },
  devServer: {
    static: "./dist",
  },
  mode: "development",
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### Step one

```shell
// using npm
npm install @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts

// using yarn
rm package-lock.json
yarn add @ukic/canary-web-components @ukic/fonts

```

### Step two

In the file defined as the `entry` in the `webpack.config.js`, add the following:

```jsx
//src/index.js
import "@ukic/fonts/dist/fonts.css";
import "@ukic/canary-web-components/dist/core/core.css";

import { defineCustomElements } from "@ukic/canary-web-components/loader";

defineCustomElements();
```

### Step three

You can now use any of the ICDS components so long as your HTML page includes the output file defined in your `webpack.config.js`. For example, including an [ic-status-tag](../../components/status-tags/code) below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Getting Started with ICDS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
    <ic-data-table ....></ic-data-table>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Known Issues

At the time of writing, there is an issue with importing Stencil components into another Stencil component library for Unit tests. 
The current workaround is to initially build and test the canary component within the web components directory and then move across when ready.
